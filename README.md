# Combining Spotify Navigation Lab and Triviachat Lab

In this lab, we're going to be combining the two labs we worked on last week. Instead of a list of songs that can be pressed to view song details, you'll end up with a list of conversations/chatbots that can be pressed to open up that conversation!

### Setup Repository
1. Click "Use as Template" and use the name "snapchatbots-yourname"
2. Clone from your new repo into your desired folder with terminal
3. Open the project code in VSCode (use `code .` if you can)
4. Open terminal in the VSCode window then run `yarn` to install packages
5. Launch the project with `yarn expo start`

You will not need to setup Spotify because I used some dummy data for the tracks

## Milestone
Once you have the starter code up and running please move onto (Milestone One)[https://github.com/Snap-Engineering-Academy-2024/Milestones/blob/main/Week5-Day2/1-chatgpt-at-home.md]
